-- Themes -- a whole client look, loaded from a file rather than written in Lua.
--
-- Every value a stylesheet rule takes has a spelling a file can carry: a colour is a table of numbers, a
-- face is named rather than handed over, a picture is named by its resource or by a path inside this
-- folder. So a theme needs no Lua at all -- it is a JSON document, and this addon is the two lines that
-- read one and install it:
--
--     local doc = hafen.json():parse(hafen.asset():get("themes/x.json"):text())
--     hafen.ui():sheet():load(doc.rules):install()
--
-- What is left over is bookkeeping: which files there are, which one is on, and remembering that across
-- a restart. The sheet itself is owned by this addon, so `:reload`, disabling it or `:theme off` puts the
-- client's own look back to the pixel.

-- ------------------------------------------------------------------ where the themes are
--
-- hafen.asset() loads a file by path and interns it; it does not enumerate a folder, and there is no verb
-- anywhere in the API that reads a directory -- an addon reads its own files, it does not browse them. So
-- the folder carries its own index, and adding a theme is two edits: drop the .json in, name it in
-- index.json. That is also what makes the order the list comes out in the author's rather than the
-- filesystem's.
local FOLDER = "themes/"
local INDEX  = FOLDER .. "index.json"

-- The word that gives the look back instead of naming a theme. A file that would claim it is skipped: the
-- release has to stay reachable, or a broken theme could only be undone by editing files.
local RELEASE = "off"

-- ------------------------------------------------------------------ state

local themes  = {}    -- name -> { name, file, title, description, rules }
local order   = {}    -- the names, in the index's own order
local active  = nil   -- the name installed by this addon, or nil for the client's own look
local settings = hafen.store():get("settings")   -- account-wide; filled before this file runs

-- ------------------------------------------------------------------ reading the folder

local function read(path)
  local ok, res = pcall(function() return hafen.json():parse(hafen.asset():get(path):text()) end)
  if not ok then return nil, tostring(res) end
  if type(res) ~= "table" then return nil, "the document is not an object" end
  return res
end

-- The name a theme is typed by is its FILE, minus the extension -- so what the user types is what is on
-- disk, and two themes cannot collide over a `name` field either of them is free to write.

        .. '" is how the client\'s own look is given back, so a theme cannot be called that')
    elseif themes[name] ~= nil then

    else
      local doc, derr = read(FOLDER .. file)

-- ------------------------------------------------------------------ installing one
--
-- An addon owns exactly one sheet, so `:load` replaces what it said and `:install()` is the moment it
-- becomes what the client looks like. A rule this theme does not name falls back on the spot, which is why
-- switching themes needs no undo step: the second install is the whole of it.

local function install(name)
  local t = themes[name]
  if t == nil then return false, 'no theme called "' .. name .. '"' end
  local ok, err = pcall(function() hafen.ui():sheet():load(t.rules):install() end)
  if not ok then
    -- A refused rule leaves the sheet holding half a theme, and half a theme is not a look anyone asked
    -- for. Give it back rather than leaving the client wearing it.
    pcall(function() hafen.ui():sheet():release() end)
    active = nil

-- ------------------------------------------------------------------ the option that says which
--
-- THE LOOK IS A SETTING, so it is declared where the client keeps settings: one choice option, holding
-- "off" and every theme the folder turned out to carry. It is declared from `Load` rather than in the file
-- body, because what it offers is what the index named and that is not known until the folder has been
-- read -- an option may be declared at any point in an addon's life.
--
-- THE OPTION IS ALSO THE ANSWER. The command below writes it instead of installing anything itself, so
-- there is one path into a theme and one place the theme in force lives. A theme the folder no longer
-- carries is simply not among the choices, and the client falls back to the option's default, which is
-- the release.

local opts = hafen.client():options():addon()

-- THE STEP, AND NOT THE PICK. Installing a sheet sweeps every character's widget tree, and a pick on the
-- page is answered inside the tree of whatever put the Options window up -- a second tree, which no
-- handler may take while it holds one (api/threading.md).

-- addon's own account-wide saved variable, so one remembered there seeds the option -- and this is the last
-- thing that ever reads it from there, which is why it is taken out on the way past. One naming a theme the
-- folder has stopped carrying seeds nothing, exactly as a stored value the option no longer offers would.
