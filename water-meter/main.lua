-- Water Meter -- every drop of water you are carrying, drawn as one stamina bar.
--
-- The bar counts the water containers in the backpack, in the equipment window, and inside anything
-- either of them holds -- a worn belt, a pouch, a creel, a stack -- at any depth. Empty ones count too:
-- an empty waterskin is capacity you are carrying and have not filled, and a bar that ignored it would
-- read 100% for a man about to die of thirst. How that is possible when an empty container tells the
-- client nothing at all is the block further down.
--
-- Nothing here polls. A container announces what enters and leaves it (ItemAdded / ItemRemoved), and an
-- item announces the moment its own tooltip resolves or is revised (Changed) -- which is what a drink,
-- a refill and "the client has just worked out what this is" all look like from here. The tally is
-- recomputed once per frame, and only when one of those has fired.

-- ------------------------------------------------------------------ the look of gfx/hud/meter/stam

-- The client's own IMeter: a 101x24 frame with a 75x10 hole at (22, 7). It paints the trough black, the
-- fill over that, and blits the frame last, so the frame's border sits on top of the bar's ends.

-- What a liquid container states about its inside, e.g. "4.55 l of Water". The substance itself is never
-- named to the client -- that rendered line is the whole of what arrives -- so the line is what we match
-- on, and the number in front of it is the only figure in litres anywhere in the API.

-- ------------------------------------------------------------------ what a container holds when full
--
-- A container that is completely empty publishes NOTHING to the client: no contents line, no fill meter,
-- no capacity, nothing at all to say it is even a water container. So the only way to know that an empty
-- waterskin is a 3 l waterskin is to have seen one with water in it -- and how much a waterskin takes is
-- a fact about the KIND of container rather than about that one item, so it is learned per resource name
-- and kept in the account's saved variables.
--
-- That is what stops the bar reading 100% the moment you log in. Two waterskins, one full and one empty,
-- are one resource name: the full one teaches the capacity and the empty one is charged for it in the
-- same frame. Carry nothing but empties and the store answers from the last time you carried a full one.
