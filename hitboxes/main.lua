-- Hitboxes -- one key cycles the footprints of everything in view through three modes: off, laid on the
-- ground, and drawn through everything standing in front of them. Assign the key in
-- Options > Keybindings > Hitboxes.
--
-- The shape is gob:hitbox() in all three, the rings the object's own resource carries, and BOTH drawing
-- modes are the same patches on the same ground: hafen.virtual():patch() lies on the terrain with no float
-- and no gap, follows a slope, and one anchored to a Gob moves and ends with that object -- so this addon
-- keeps almost no bookkeeping of its own. The MODE is one flag on those patches:
--
--   ground  the world may hide it, which is what a patch does until it is told otherwise. A box behind a
--           wall is behind the wall and a box under a house is under it, so you read the boxes as part of
--           the world.
--   over    patch:occluded(false) -- the hills, the walls and the houses in front of a ring stop cutting it,
--           so a box inside a barn or over the brow of a hill is drawn whole, which is the point of the
--           mode. It is STILL on the ground: the same ring on the same relief with one test switched off,
--           not a flat shape thrown over the screen. And the interface is still over it, because a patch is
--           drawn inside the world and your windows are drawn after the world is finished -- so the boxes
--           never cover your inventory.
--
-- Everything else about how a box LOOKS -- the fill's colour and how much of the ground reads through it,
-- the rim's colour and how thick it is -- is four rows on the page, and not this file's to decide. Both
-- modes wear the same look, so what the page shows is what you get in either one and the mode is the flag
-- alone.
--
-- A look being a look, every one of those five rows re-dresses the patches already down rather than taking
-- them up: a tint, a border and the flag cost no terrain work, where laying a box again re-cuts every tile
-- under it. Only `off` lays and drops.
--
-- With the world not hiding them, two rings that overlap stack in whatever order the client draws them in,
-- and that order is not this addon's to set. Every box wears the same colours, so the picture is the same
-- either way.
--
-- The building you are PLACING wears a box in both. That one is not a game object -- it is the client's own
-- ghost on the cursor, in no session's object cache -- so it is read from the world rather than found among
-- the gobs: s:world():placing() is the handle, and placing:hitbox() is the same rings in the same units.
--
-- gob:hitbox() answers nil for a resource that carries no shape at all -- a decoration, most flooring --
-- and those are simply not drawn: there is no hitbox to show. Nor does a shape coming back mean the object
-- blocks movement; a felled log has a click-box and no collision. This addon draws what the verb answers.

-- there is no picture under a patch for a blend strength to be measured against. The rim is left solid,
-- which is why the row above it says `fill`: :alpha(a) would have carried the border down with it, and a

-- ---------------------------------------------------------------- keeping a laid box straight

-- box sideways -- unless the patch is turned by as much as the object has since its rings were read, which
-- is what this is. It is its own timer, and a fast one, because a running creature turns between sweeps;
-- it is affordable there because turning a patch re-carves the ground it already covers and rebuilds no
-- mesh, where taking a box up and laying it again re-cuts every tile under it.
