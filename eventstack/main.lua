-- EventStack -- one line per thing the client did, newest FIRST, and one click for what it carried.
--
-- It OBSERVES, and that is all it does. Nowhere in this file is there a preventDefault, a rewrite, a
-- resend or a send: an inbound wildcard that cancels stops the client outright -- the widget tree stops
-- hearing from the server, and the bus goes quiet with it -- and a log is the last place to put one.
--
-- FIVE DOORS, ONE RECORD. Every source funnels into push(r), so however differently the doors are
-- addressed there is one shape to narrow, one column set and one list. Four of them are ambient -- the
-- client sends, receives, puts an event on the bus, opens and closes a widget, and a wildcard hears it.
-- The fifth is not: a control's own key (a button's Pressed, a list's Changed) fires only for somebody
-- who subscribed to that widget, so `ui` walks the tree and holds a subscription per control, which is
-- how the one door a wildcard cannot reach gets into the same list as the rest. It never cancels: the ev
-- on a borrowed key can stop the client's own action, and a log that stopped a button working would be a
-- bug with a window around it.
--
-- AND THE ROW WRITES ITS OWN SUBSCRIPTION. That is the point of watching traffic at all: you make the
-- thing happen, you find the row, and what you actually need is the line that catches it next time. So
-- the detail carries it, spelled for the door the row came through and guarded by the widget column,
-- because one message name is sent by several widgets and a handler that assumes otherwise reads an
-- argument that was never there.
--
-- FOUR AXES AND A WORD. A record is narrowed by its source, by the session it happened on, by the widget
-- it was about, by its event name, and by a substring of the whole line. Every axis FILLS ITSELF from
-- what has arrived: a message name is the server's and a widget class is the client's, so no list of
-- either can be written in advance -- each starts as (all) alone and gains a row the first time a value
-- lands on it. And dropdown:rows(t) REPLACES the set and CLEARS the pick, so every repopulation writes
-- the pick back -- without that the user's filter falls off the moment an unseen name arrives, which is
-- exactly when they are watching something.
--
-- WHAT IS CAPTURED AND WHAT IS SHOWN ARE TWO QUESTIONS. The four checkboxes open and shut the
-- subscriptions themselves, so unticking one stops the recording and loses what comes next; the source
-- dropdown narrows what is DRAWN out of what was already recorded, and loses nothing.
--
-- NEWEST FIRST, because a list keeps the scroll where the user left it. Appending downwards puts every
-- new line below the fold of a window nobody has scrolled, which is the one place a log must not put
-- them.
--
-- A ROW IS A STRING, and the log is a list rather than a table, because the click has to land somewhere:
-- hafen.ui():table() lays out real columns but HOLDS NOTHING -- no :value(), no Changed -- so no row of
-- one can be picked. A list holds its pick and reports it, so the columns are padded by hand and the
-- whole log is set in the client's mono face, where every character is one character wide and the
-- padding IS the column. CHAR_W is the one number that estimates that width; it decides how wide the
-- window stands and nothing else, and the header is padded through the very same helper as a row, so
-- the two can never disagree.
--
-- The seq number is not decoration. A list's pick comes back as the very row VALUE that was given, and
-- a row here is a string, so two identical lines would be one pick: "#" makes every line its own, and
-- recOf maps it back to the record behind it.
--
-- NOTHING IS DRAWN FROM A HANDLER. A handler appends to the ring and marks it dirty; the window's Tick
-- rewrites the list at most once a frame, and only while dirty, unpaused and visible.
--
-- THE HOT PATH STAYS SHORT. A handler builds one record and appends it, and what the row SAYS -- its
-- line and the lowercase haystack the word filter runs over -- is built there, once, rather than per
-- frame. What the record CARRIED is not: the args snapshot and the payload handle are kept exactly as
-- they arrived and read only when the row is clicked, so a message nobody ever looks at costs one table.
--
-- The ring is an array with a head index, never a table that shifts: dropping the oldest by shifting
-- copies the whole ring on every message. CAP is what it holds and the whole of what the list can ever
-- draw, because the interesting end of a log is the recent end: three hundred lines is a window you
-- scroll rather than a table that grows, and a record holds an args snapshot and a live handle, so a
-- ring that never dropped anything would pin every gob it ever saw.
--
-- IT RECORDS FROM THE MOMENT IT LOADS, not from the moment you open the window, because the traffic
-- worth reading has usually already happened: the tree building itself, the first `set`s that fill the
-- HUD, SessionEnteredWorld. A tool you have to open BEFORE the thing you are debugging can only ever
-- show you the second time it happens. So `at login` arms the doors as the addon loads and the window
-- is only a view on to what they caught -- opening and closing it records and loses nothing. Untick it and
-- the doors open with the window and shut with it: nothing is subscribed to anything while it is down.
--
-- NOTHING HERE IS COPYABLE, because the client has no clipboard to offer -- so `log` writes through
-- hafen.log(), where the console shows it and the terminal keeps it whole: the picked row with its whole
-- detail, or, with nothing picked, the view itself. That is the same door widgetstack's `:selector`
-- uses, and for the same reason: the point of reading a message name off a window is to type it into a
-- file.
--
-- Its place is the ACCOUNT's saved variable, not w:remember(name): that files a placement under the
-- character on screen, and this window stands in the layer, above every one of them.
