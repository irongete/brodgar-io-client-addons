-- Autodrop -- the items you name are thrown on the ground the moment they reach your backpack.
--
-- IT IS ABOUT ONE CHARACTER, AND THE WINDOW STANDS IN THAT CHARACTER'S OWN TREE. The client can hold
-- several logins at once, and a surface built the ordinary way goes in the addon layer above all of
-- them -- one window, drawn over whoever is on screen. This one is built with
-- `:parent(s:ui():match("@GameUI"))` instead (docs/addons/api/ui/custom.md), so it hangs inside that
-- character's HUD: it is drawn only while that character is on screen, it ends with them, and its place
-- is filed under them. There is one instance of everything below PER LOGIN, held in `inst` by account
-- name, and nothing here ever asks who is on screen -- except the console command, which is the client's.
--
-- THE ADDON ITSELF IS STILL ONE. It is loaded once for the client, on the login screen, before any
-- character exists (docs/addons/runtime.md). What is per character is the state it keeps, and
-- `SessionEnteredWorld` -- once per session, and again for the same session when it picks another
-- character -- is where an instance is built.
--
-- THE LIST IS THAT CHARACTER'S OWN, a per-character saved variable, so two characters keep two lists and
-- neither sees the other's. A character's tables are only readable once that session has reached the
-- world -- there is no folder before there is a character -- which is exactly the moment `adopt()` runs.
--
-- WHAT IS ON THE LIST IS A RESOURCE NAME, never a display name: the resource is an item's stable
-- identity, and a name is what its tooltip happens to say once it has resolved. So one entry answers
-- for every dandelion there will ever be, and the name beside it in the window is a label only.
--
-- WHAT CARRIES A COUNT GOES BY ITS COUNT: FULL and no other number. A pile of seeds therefore fills up in
-- your bag and goes on the ground whole, and what has no count of its own -- a dandelion, a chanterelle --
-- goes the moment it arrives, as it always did. Nothing asks what an item IS: a rule resting on what a
-- name or a resource MEANS fails by DROPPING, which is the one direction that cannot be undone.
--
-- THE COUNT IS ASKED OF TWO PLACES, because the client writes it in two. One is the number on the icon,
-- `item:quantity()`; the other is the count a counted item states in its own name -- "28 seeds of Hemp",
-- the very shape `pretty` turns round below. The name answers whenever the icon does not, and asking it is
-- what keeps a part pile out of the "carries no count at all" case -- which is the case that DROPS, and
-- the whole of why a seed pile went on the ground a handful at a time.
--
-- HELD MEANS ASKED AGAIN ON A BEAT, because a pile you add to never arrives -- it grows where it stands,
-- and the server revises its tooltip rather than sending a new item. There is no event in that to wait
-- for: the revision is only BUILT when something asks the item to describe itself -- the icon's own
-- drawing, usually -- so with the inventory shut nothing asks and nothing is announced. A pile held for
-- being short therefore goes on a list, and every BEAT it is asked again: that read takes the new count
-- and forces the build in one breath, which is the timer the docs keep for a value with no change event.
--
-- WHAT GOES ON THE GROUND IS ONE ITEM, never a kind. The drop message carries a count of ITEMS OF THAT
-- KIND -- 1 for the one you clicked, -1 for every one of them, which is the client's own ctrl+alt gesture
-- -- so the count is stated here rather than left to a default that means "all of them".
--
-- ONLY THE MAIN BACKPACK IS WATCHED. `s:ui():inventory()` is that one grid, and the subscription IS the
-- registration -- a chest, a cupboard, the study window and the equipment grid are watched for nothing,
-- so an item you deliberately put in a container is safe wherever this addon stands.
--
-- THE SLOT TAKES WHAT IS ON THE CURSOR, and that is the client's own gesture rather than a shortcut. An
-- item is never "dragged" in this game: you lift it onto the cursor and click where it goes, which is
-- exactly how it lands in a belt slot or an equipment square. The client's drag gesture -- the one
-- `widget:on("Drop", fn)` answers -- carries menu-grid actions and nothing else, so a `Drop` handler
-- here would never fire for an item at all.
--
-- A HANDLER THAT BUILDS A WIDGET STILL GOES THROUGH THE STEP, and the reason has moved rather than gone
-- (docs/addons/api/threading.md). The window is in the character's tree now, so a press on it holds THAT
-- tree -- and every builder is born in the addon layer before `:parent` re-homes it, which would be a
-- second tree. So the press decides and `hafen.timer():after(0, ...)` does: the click that adds an item,
-- the X that removes one, and the console command that opens or closes the window.
