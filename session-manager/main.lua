-- ---------------------------------------------------------------- the base under each character
--
-- The client draws none of this. It knows which character is on screen and holds the selection, and it
-- keeps both to itself: what that looks like is here, in a file the user can edit, and an addon that
-- does not want a marker at all simply does not draw one.
--
-- The base is a PATCH -- hafen.virtual():patch(), a convex ring lying flat on the terrain -- anchored to
-- the character's own body. So the GROUND is what is coloured, rather than an ellipse drawn over it: it
-- follows the relief over a slope, a ridge and a tile boundary with no gap and no shimmer, whatever stands
-- on it occludes it, and its size is in world units at every zoom. A patch that follows an object is
-- re-laid where that object moved, so it is under the feet the whole way and it ends with the body.
--
-- None of that names a camera, and that is the point: an ellipse painted in screen pixels had to
-- reconstruct the view's turn, its tilt and the height of its own anchor out of probe points, and could
-- only approximate a hillside it was drawn flat across. The ground has all three already.
--
-- The base wears its own EDGE. A patch's border is carved out of the very distance its silhouette is
-- carved from, so a line all the way round the disc is not a second shape lying on the first -- which is
-- what an annulus would have had to be, and an annulus is not convex, and convex is the whole of what a
-- ring may be.
--
-- The line is what makes the ground read as a PLINTH rather than as a smudge, and it needs the fill and
-- the edge to carry their own opacities: the fill's is the fourth component of its tint, the line's is its
-- own colour's, and each is written once. :alpha() is not used here at all -- it multiplies the whole
-- patch, so it would fade the line along with the ground it stands round, which is the one thing the base
-- wants not to happen.
