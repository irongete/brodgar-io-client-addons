-- Simple Chat -- the client's chat, with the channel list as TABS across the top.
--
-- The client puts its channels down the LEFT side of the chat, one tab under the last, and the window is
-- docked into the HUD: it cannot be moved and it cannot be resized. This addon draws the same channels and
-- the same lines in a window of its own, with real tabs standing along the top, dragged by its body and
-- sized from its bottom-right corner. The client's own chat is hidden while this runs.
--
-- TWO HALVES, NOT ONE WIDGET, and that is what makes the tabs tabs. `root` is an invisible box that draws
-- nothing and exists only to hold them; the chat's own rectangle starts BELOW the strip the tabs stand in.
-- So a tab is not inside the chat's frame reaching up -- it is outside it, above it, a sibling of that
-- rectangle rather than a child of it. Anything else clips: a child is drawn inside its parent's box, so a
-- tab hung on the panel could never rise above the panel's own top edge.
--
--     root ┌──────────────────────────────┐
--          │ [System][Area][Green]        │   <- the tabs: siblings of the panel, standing above it
--          │ ╔═════════╝      ╚═══════════╗│   <- the frame, with the lit tab's mouth left undrawn
--          │ ║ panel: the lines, the line ║│   <- the field: the action bars' colour, at their alpha
--          │ ╚════════════════════════════╝│
--          └──────────────────────────────┘
--
-- AND THAT RECTANGLE IS ITSELF TWO THINGS. `panel` is the FIELD and carries no border whatever; the FRAME
-- is drawn over it through three windows which between them leave one stretch of its top edge undrawn
-- (`cutFrame`). That gap is the mouth, and it has to BE a gap rather than a patch of paint: the field is
-- translucent, and nothing translucent hides brass.
--
-- The tab ON SCREEN stands exactly where the others do and is cut exactly as they are: same top row, same
-- brass down both sides. Its FOOT is the only difference -- it is open, and it reaches on down through the
-- air the others leave under them until it is in the frame, so its fill runs into that gap and the two
-- become one shape. The others are closed boxes, touching nothing. That difference -- a missing line along
-- the bottom, and the air under the ones that keep theirs -- is the whole of what says
-- "this tab is the mouth of that panel", and it is why the art is a file rather than a
-- {color=, width=} line: a line goes all the way round by definition.
--
-- AND THE METAL IS ONE METAL. A tab's art is the panel's own frame -- `gfx/hud/wnd`, cut into files at the
-- design pixels the client draws it at -- so the brass does not resemble the window's, it IS the window's.
-- What that buys is the JOINT: at each end of the mouth the frame's top run turns UP into the selected
-- tab's side and the line never breaks. No nine-slice can cut that corner, because all four of its own have
-- the metal in one quadrant and the world round three, and this one is the other way about. So it is mitred
-- from the two runs' own cross-sections and laid over the end of the mouth (`joint-l.png`, `joint-r.png`).
--
-- ONE WINDOW PER CHARACTER, AND IT HANGS ON THAT CHARACTER'S OWN HUD. A chat belongs to a login -- two
-- characters have two System logs and two Party channels -- so the window that shows one belongs to that
-- login too: built from SessionEnteredWorld into its `@GameUI`, and dying with it. Nothing here exists
-- before a character does, which is the whole of why there is no chat window on the login screen and none
-- on the character list -- not a window kept hidden there, no window at all.
--
-- TWO OF THEM ARE NEVER ON SCREEN AT ONCE, either, and that is not this addon's doing: the client holds
-- every login as a live session and DRAWS ONE (`Sessions`, the anchor). The other character's window is
-- not hidden and not moved aside -- it is simply not in the tree the frame walks. So a window per login
-- costs the user nothing to look at, and it buys the thing that matters: each one reads its OWN chat, so
-- there is no "point the window at whoever is on screen" step to get wrong.
--
-- PICKING ANOTHER CHARACTER ON THE SAME ACCOUNT IS A REBUILD, not a restore. The session lives on -- the
-- server hands it a new world rather than ending it -- but the HUD is torn down and a new one put up, and
-- this window goes with it. SessionEnteredWorld fires a second time for that same session, and that is
-- where the new one is built.
--
-- THE PRESS MODEL. root:draggable(grip) hands the whole body to the user, and a press on a drag handle
-- starts the gesture and does NOTHING else -- so anything that wants a click of its own has to sit ABOVE
-- the grip and consume the press. Children are hit before their parent and the last one added is on top,
-- so the order things are built in IS the input order: grip first, then the panel and the frame over it,
-- then the tabs, which are therefore also drawn OVER the frame. The log subscribes to Draw and Wheel only -- a
-- surface with no MouseDown answers false, so a press on it falls through to the grip and drags.
--
-- THE LAYOUT RUNS ON UPDATE, NOT AT BUILD. A control DRAWS NOTHING UNTIL THE TICK AFTER the statement that
-- built it, so a text entry's height -- its own art's, the one measurement this window cannot pick -- is
-- not there to be read in the breath that built it. Update re-lays the window whenever its box or that
-- height moves. Everything is nevertheless BUILT at the right coordinates using ENTRY_H as a stand-in, so
-- the window is never wrong even for one frame, and the fold only corrects.
--
-- AND THE CLIENT'S CHAT IS NOT TAKEN AWAY UNTIL THAT LAYOUT HAS SUCCEEDED ONCE. An addon that hides the
-- chat and then fails to stand in for it leaves the player with no chat AND no way to read the error,
-- since the error is written to the very channel it just hid.

-- EIGHT, AND IT IS MEASURED. A {box = "gfx/hud/wnd"} border reserves its corner's own size, which is what
-- `new IBox.Scaled("gfx/hud/wnd", ...).ctloff()` answers: (8, 8) design px. The client's own windows look
-- like they use 5 because `Window.wbox` is a subclass that subtracts UI.scale(3,3) so its content may sit
-- over the frame's soft outer edge -- that subtraction is the WINDOW's, not the border's, and a rule that
-- names the box gets the plain 8. Guessing this from a window is how the tabs came out two pixels adrift.
local EDGE_T   = 8
local PAD      = EDGE_T + 2   -- the room content keeps inside the frame, so nothing sits on the art
-- ONE PIXEL, AND IT IS NOT ARBITRARY. The tab ON SCREEN is sunk this far into the frame's box, so that its
-- foot and the window below it OVERLAP rather than merely meet: two boxes that only touch can still be
-- pulled a hairline apart by the scale the client draws at, and what opens in that hairline is raw world,
-- between a tab and the window it belongs to. SEAT is what closes it. No other tab carries it, because no
-- other tab reaches the frame at all (TAB_LIFT).
--
-- IT IS ALSO WHY THE FIELD STARTS ONE ROW LOWER THAN THE FRAME. The field is translucent, so a row painted
-- twice is not the same colour as a row painted once -- the tab's foot laid over the field would draw a
-- line across the very mouth it exists to open. So the row the foot occupies is the row the field gives up:
-- the frame's box begins at STRIP and the panel's at STRIP + SEAT, the two are painted side by side and
-- never over each other, and the overlap that closes the hairline costs nothing.
local SEAT     = 1
local GAP      = 2            -- between two tabs, and between two lines
-- A TAB WEARS THE PANEL'S OWN FRAME, at its own weight, which is what these two numbers are: the corner
-- `gfx/hud/wnd` reserves and the thickness of its edge runs. A tab's art is sliced at the CORNER and a
-- joint is one RUN square, because a joint is exactly where two runs cross.
local CORNER   = 8
local RUN      = 7
local TAB_H    = 28           -- a tab that is not on screen: the run, a line of text, the run
-- EVERY TAB STARTS ON THE SAME ROW, this far down the strip -- the lit one included. It is the strip's own
-- top margin and nothing else: a tab that reached higher than its neighbours would read as a bigger tab
-- rather than as the open one, and what says "open" is the FOOT, which is the end nobody else has.
local TAB_DROP = 3
-- AND THE AIR UNDER IT. Only the tab ON SCREEN belongs to the panel: it plugs into the frame and opens a
-- mouth there. A tab that is not on screen belongs to nothing yet, so it does not touch the frame either --
-- it stands clear of it by this much, and the gap is the whole of what says "this one is not the one you
-- are reading". The selected tab reaches down through the same air and past it.
local TAB_LIFT = 1
local STRIP    = TAB_DROP + TAB_H + TAB_LIFT   -- the band above the panel that the tabs live in
-- THE SELECTED TAB ENDS AT THE FRAME'S TOP EDGE and goes no further. Running it on -- down over the
-- border to meet the log -- drags its two brass SIDES down with it, and a pair of verticals crossing the
-- frame into the content is the mistake that made this look wrong. A real tab's sides stop at the frame;
-- what reaches past it is the hole the tab opens, and a hole is not a shape a nine-slice can cut -- which
-- is why the frame is not one here (see `cutFrame`).
--
-- So the lit tab is EXACTLY its neighbours plus the air they leave under them: same top, same width, the
-- same brass down both sides, and the one difference is that it goes on to where the frame is instead of
-- stopping short of it. That difference is TAB_LIFT tall, and it is the whole of what it means to be open.
local TAB_ON_H = STRIP - TAB_DROP
-- ...and how far down the frame is CUT where that tab meets it: past every pixel the frame draws along its

local TAB_MIN  = 44           -- ...and as narrow as one may be squeezed, the two runs included
-- The corner the user grabs, and it is EXACTLY the frame's own corner -- PAD square, flush with the panel's
-- bottom-right. A grip standing inside the field instead would have to be kept clear, and the only thing
-- that can give it that room is the line the user types in: the entry would stop a grip's width short of
-- the frame and leave a bite out of the window's one full-width control. So the grip goes on the brass,
-- where nothing else is, and the entry runs to the ink like every other row.
local SIZER    = PAD

-- WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE WHEN NOBODY SAYS OTHERWISE, and every bit of it is DECLARED rather than painted.
-- `:stock` is the bottom of the style cascade, so any rule -- a theme's -- beats it, per property, without
-- this addon knowing that themes exist; painting the same pixels in a Draw handler would be final and
-- reachable by nothing. `:name` is the other half, and the one that enables: the engine writes this addon's
-- id in front, so the selector a theme writes is [name=simple-chat/panel].
-- A TAB IS CUT FROM THE PANEL'S OWN FRAME, and the shipped files are that frame and nothing else:
-- `gfx/hud/wnd`'s four corners and four runs, downsampled from the scale the client authors them at to the
-- design pixels a file is authored in. So a tab is the same brass the panel's border is -- not a band that
-- resembles it -- and the two meet without a seam because they are one material.
--
-- THE TAB ON SCREEN IS CUT 8/8/8/1: corners and runs down three sides, and a bottom slice of ONE row that
-- carries the two side runs and nothing between them. That is the open foot, and it is why the sides reach
-- the tab's own bottom edge instead of stopping a corner short of it.

-- them reads as a second border the window has not got. So the field is the PANEL's own bg, painted at the
-- frame's own box, and the log paints nothing at all. What looks like the background behind the lines IS
-- the panel's, and the room the lines keep off the frame is a margin INSIDE one colour rather than a second
-- colour around them.
--
-- TRANSLUCENT, WHICH IS WHAT THE FRAME COSTS. A border's centre is never painted -- that is bg's job -- so
-- nothing this window draws can HIDE the brass under a tab's mouth: at this alpha the frame's top run would
-- ghost straight through any patch laid over it. What opens the mouth, therefore, is not paint but the
-- absence of it: the frame is drawn through windows that leave that stretch of its top edge undrawn

-- being the same colour at the same alpha over the same world, is literally the same pixels.

-- action bar's height and a fifth of its length, which is why a bar reads as unable to leave the screen at
-- all; on a chat three hundred tall and eight hundred wide the same allowance lets most of it walk off. So
-- this says outright what the bars only appear to say: the window is kept inside, entire.
--
-- Inside WHAT is the character's HUD, which is the screen: `@GameUI` is that login's whole view, so the
-- rule is the one it always was, and a client window made smaller pulls this one back in on the next frame.
