-- Simple Gob Hider -- one key takes the objects you named out of the scene and lays a yellow patch on
-- the ground each of them stands on. Assign the key in Options > Keybindings > Simple Gob Hider.
--
-- The patch is a hafen.virtual():patch(), anchored to the object itself. That is what makes the ground mark
-- the object's own footprint rather than a flat shape drawn over it: a patch lies ON the terrain, so it
-- follows a slope, and whatever stands there occludes it.
--
-- Three things the API carries, so this file does not. A patch anchored to a Gob ENDS with that Gob, so a
-- felled tree takes its own mark down. The rim is patch:border(c, w), one line at one colour and one
-- thickness all the way round the ring -- so a mark is ONE patch, and the ground pays one overlay for it
-- rather than one per edge. And a thing standing in the world belongs to the world rather than to the
-- character who put it there, so the mark is visible from every login that can see the object -- where a
-- screen-space painter can only place ground through the session being drawn, and leaves another login's
-- trees hidden but unmarked.

-- Each entry matches as a plain SUBSTRING of gob:name(), the resource name the server sent, so
-- "gfx/terobjs/trees/" takes every tree and "trees/fir" only firs. To learn a name, stand next to it:
--   :lua hafen.log():write(tostring(hafen.session():current():world():gob():nearest():name()))
