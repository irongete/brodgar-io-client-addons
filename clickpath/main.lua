-- ---------------------------------------------------------------- waypoints and their flags

-- A waypoint is its place plus the flag standing on it, so the two can never drift apart: the flag
-- is planted when the point is queued and struck when it is reached, dropped or replaced.
--
-- The flag needs no session: hafen.virtual() takes a Position, and a Position carries no session, so one
-- planted by any character stands in whichever world is drawn. Ground the drawn character cannot locate
-- is a legal place to stand one -- the entity exists and simply is not drawn -- which is the same answer
-- the lines below give for that place, by construction rather than by agreement.

-- ---------------------------------------------------------------- the paths, drawn

-- hafen.virtual() has no line primitive -- its five collections are props, images, glTF meshes, widgets
-- and ground patches, and :scale is uniform, so a sprite cannot be stretched into a segment. The path is
-- therefore drawn from the projected world points, which is what worldToScreen is for.

-- The RECEIVER picks the layer, and there is no switch to set: hafen.ui():overlay() paints after the
-- whole root has drawn, so it covers every window; a painter hung on a WIDGET runs in that widget's
-- own draw slot instead. Ours hangs on the MapView, so the client's windows -- inventory, chat, belt,
-- the action menu -- all draw after it and cover the lines, and the lines are clipped to the map's box.

-- EVERY character's path is drawn, not the screen's alone. Only one UI is drawn at a time, so this is
-- one screen showing several characters' paths rather than several screens: the projection is the DRAWN
-- session's -- worldToScreen answers nil for any other -- while the places it projects may belong to anyone,
-- since a Position carries no session. An alt walking ground this character cannot locate projects nil
-- and its legs are simply not drawn, which is the honest answer rather than a hole.
--
-- ONLY A QUEUED PATH IS DRAWN. A plain click is tracked all the same -- the entry is what the next
-- alt-click queues behind, and what the stuck poll below drops -- but the client already shows that walk
-- with its own cursor, so a line over it would be the addon claiming a walk it did not queue.
