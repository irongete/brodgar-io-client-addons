-- Builder helper -- remembers what every building site you have opened still needs, and one key floats
-- each material's have/total over the site itself.
--
-- A building site is one gob for every building in the game (gfx/terobjs/consobj); what it is becoming and
-- what it still wants are not on the object. They are in the window the server opens when you right-click
-- it: one material box (@ISBox) per material, each drawing an icon and a "have/total" figure, and the
-- window's caption is the building's name. Nothing on the wire ties that window to the site, so the addon
-- watches the two gestures that open one -- a right-click on a site, and placing a new one -- and claims the
-- window that comes for the gesture. A build window opening while a right-click stands is that click's. One
-- that was already open -- for a site just placed, or one you had open before -- is taken once the drawn
-- character has stood still for a few seconds with no window come for the click: the server answers a
-- click within the round trip after you arrive, so a window that has not come by then is not coming, and
-- the newest build window nothing has claimed is the site's. A click on the ground keeps the gesture (that
-- is you steering the walk); a click on any other object, or placing something, ends it.
--
-- A claimed window is then READ WHOLE: its boxes, in tree order, ARE the site's materials, and the record
-- is that reading. Everything that can change what the window says goes through the same read -- the claim
-- itself, a box arriving or leaving, a figure moving after the record was dropped -- so the record is
-- always the window's own answer rather than a pile of arrivals, and a record left wrong by anything at all
-- is rewritten whole the next time its window is read.
--
-- A site is filed by its place, as a Position, and Position is durable: it saves as a grid id plus an offset
-- within the grid, which is the one anchor that means the same thing to every character. The record lives
-- in an account-scope saved variable, so a site opened by one character is known to all of them and
-- survives a restart. Once every material is complete the record is dropped, since there is nothing left to
-- show -- and a figure moving in a window still open brings it straight back.
--
-- The labels are one painter per site, hung on the gob at ground level: for each material, the material's
-- own icon and its figure, stacked upward from the ground the site stands on. The painter reads the
-- record, so a change the window reports (a "chnum" update on a box, while it is open) shows on the next
-- frame with nothing re-attached. WHETHER A SITE WEARS ITS PAINTER IS ASKED OF THE GOB, never of a table
-- of our own: gob:overlay():get(KEY) is the one truth, so a painter lost by any means is simply hung again
-- the next time the site is asked. Anything about a gob that has not resolved yet -- ground not yet
-- durable, a name still streaming, a drawing the client is still resolving -- is waited out on a timer
-- while the object exists, because the client has no event for any of those moments.
