-- widgetstack -- a WoW /framestack clone + a click-to-inspect widget inspector + the SELECTOR INSPECTOR
-- (spec 20, W2; spec 030 B2). The standing in-game harness for the W-series widget introspection: it shows the
-- live stack of widgets under the cursor, outlines the hovered one, and lets you CLICK any level (or any child
-- inside an inspector) to open a window with that widget's full details -- a browsable widget inspector, built
-- entirely in pure Lua over W1/W2.
--
-- W2 adds the two reads that find *what is under the cursor* -- the only pieces missing from W1's tree:
--   hafen.ui():mouse()   -> the pointer entity: :x()/:y() the cursor in root coords (public UI.mc), polled
--                         each frame; also :over()/:shift()/:ctrl()/:alt()/:grab() (unused here)
--   hafen.ui():hit(x, y) -> the DEEPEST Widget object under that point, or nil. It mirrors the engine's own
--                         pointer dispatch, so it resolves EXACTLY the widget a real click would hit --
--                         correct under SCROLL offsets and non-rectangular hit areas (a naive rect test
--                         is wrong there). Walk :parent() up from the hit for the full stack.
--   w:rootPos()        -> { x=, y= }   the widget's top-left in root coords, for the highlight box
--
-- 030.3 / 049.4 -- THE SELECTOR INSPECTOR (the bottom panel). A selector system without one is unusable: nobody
-- guesses a widget's role. For the hovered widget the panel shows its role (or an honest nil), its class, its OWN
-- [title=]/[text=] and its [res=], then the ANCHOR STEP -- the nearest enclosing window -- and then every selector
-- built from those parts that ACTUALLY matches it, most specific first, each with how many widgets it matches and
-- this one's index among them. The bottom line is ready to paste into `:lua`.
--   * 049.4 -- THE GRAMMAR IS CSS, so an attribute tests the widget its step is WRITTEN ON: [title=] is a WINDOW's
--     own caption (and is a parse error anywhere else), [text=] is the words any other widget displays. Reaching
--     the enclosing window is a step of its own in front, separated by a space: the descendant combinator. So the
--     panel builds CHAIN candidates (`window[title=Cupboard] button[text=Close]`), which is what names ONE widget
--     while two Cupboards are open.
--   * The operators come with it. [res=] is EXACT, so the panel offers [res*=<last path segment>] beside it -- the
--     contains form. And where a value has a stable stem before its first digit ("Hunger: 87%"), it offers
--     [text^=Hunger:], the form that keeps matching when the tail moves; the walk below decides which of the two
--     is actually true.
--   * The list is SELF-VALIDATING: each candidate is resolved with s:ui():matchAll() and kept only if the hovered
--     widget is in the result. So nothing is ever offered that does not resolve -- which is exactly the claim
--     the offered line makes. A candidate that does not even PARSE is dropped by the same pcall.
--   * `s:ui():match("sel")` is offered only where the candidate matches this widget and NOTHING else;
--     otherwise the line is `s:ui():matchAll("sel")[i]`, because match() refuses an ambiguous answer rather than
--     handing back whichever widget the walk met first. The offered line is the most specific candidate that
--     names it ALONE, falling back to the most specific of all -- a chain usually IS the one that names it alone.
--   * "*" is deliberately omitted: it matches every widget, so it says nothing and it is the one walk that
--     interns the whole tree.
--   * THE PRICE IS REPORTED: a chain candidate costs one more tree walk than the flat candidate it extends, so
--     the header line says how many walks the last rebuild cost and how many of them were chains.
-- Click any panel row (or run `:selector`) to LOG the line -- chat-log text is selectable, which is how it
-- leaves the client. Freeze first (the "freeze" hotkey), or moving the mouse to the window re-hovers.
--
-- THE EFFICIENCY GUARD (029.1: plain `==`): Update fires EVERY frame, but the hovered widget only
-- changes when the mouse moves onto a different one. So we cache the last hovered leaf and BAIL EARLY when
-- it hasn't changed -- no tree walk, no selector resolution, no window rebuild, per frame. A per-rebuild
-- counter (and the number of selector walks it cost), shown in the window, does NOT tick while the cursor
-- sits still. Widget objects are INTERNED, so two lookups of the same live widget are the SAME value and
-- `==` IS the identity test -- :same() is gone with the collapse.
--
-- THE INSPECTOR: the stack rows are CLICKABLE -- click one and a new "Inspector" window opens with that
-- widget's type/id/pos/size/rootpos/visible/text + role/res + its selector + its parent link + its child
-- list. Inside an inspector, click a child (to descend) or the parent link (to ascend) to open a further
-- inspector window. Freeze the stack first (the "freeze" hotkey) so it holds still while you move the mouse
-- into the window to click a row. That hotkey starts UNBOUND: assign it under Options > Keybindings >
-- Widgetstack (suggested: Ctrl+Shift+F).
--
-- 063.4 -- WHAT IT ANSWERS. Under both of those sits the read block: everything the widget will answer about
-- ITSELF, driven off ONE table in ONE fixed order (see READS) so the hover panel and every Inspector window
-- print the same lines in the same places. A line appears only where the read answered something, so what
-- you are looking at is what the widget HAS -- see describe().
