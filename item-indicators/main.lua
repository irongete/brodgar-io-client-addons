-- Item Indicators -- what an item says about itself, on its own icon: the quality as a label -- the mean of
-- what it holds, where it is a stack -- and the durability it has left as the bar the client draws for a
-- waterskin's water.
--
-- Both hang off one subscription and one revision listener per icon, because both are answers to the same
-- question -- the item's tooltip -- and it arrives once, a moment after the icon does.
--
-- Nothing here polls. An icon is announced as it is built, and an item announces the moment its own tooltip
-- resolves or is revised: a repair, a point of wear, a quality the client has only just worked out. The
-- label is drawn by the client and costs no Lua at all per frame, and the bar is attached only to an icon
-- that actually has a wear row, so an inventory of unwearable things costs nothing either.

-- ------------------------------------------------------------------ the quality label
--
-- The number is two real widgets rather than an overlay, and the reason is themes: pixels an addon lays down
-- in a Draw handler are final -- a rule is a value the client reads, not a painter that reaches into a
-- callback -- while a widget an addon NAMES can be found by a rule, and what it declares as its `stock` sits
-- at the BOTTOM of the cascade, under every rule. So this look is a default anybody can beat, per property,
-- and a theme dresses it by writing ["[name=item-indicators/quality]"] without either addon knowing the
-- other. A widget:rule() of ours would sit at the TOP, where no theme could reach past it.
--
-- The plate is a bare surface carrying the black; the text is one of the client's own Labels, because a
-- Label re-renders when a font override on its scope moves and is therefore the one text a rule can dress.

-- The plate never narrows past two digits, so a column of icons carries one shape rather than a ragged edge
-- of one-, two- and three-digit boxes. There is no verb that measures a string, so the floor is taken from a
-- label rendering "00" -- the widest two digits in any face -- once, off the first label built.

-- ------------------------------------------------------------------ the look of ui/tt/level
--
-- Level.drawmeter is not a rectangle. Its backdrop spans the strip's width and is two pixels taller than
-- the strip; its two end caps are one-pixel lines that span only the strip's own rows. So the four corner
-- pixels are never painted, and that cut corner is what reads as a rounded end.
--
-- Reproducing it is not a matter of copying the arithmetic, because that arithmetic is written in two units
-- at once: the strip's height and the margin are UI.scale'd, while the 1s, 2s and 3s that frame them are raw
-- SCREEN pixels. A frame written as "1" through a design-pixel verb is one screen pixel on an unscaled client
-- and two on one at interface scale 2 -- and a corner cut out of a design pixel cannot be cut at all.
--
-- So this draws in SCREEN pixels, through the one verb that can. g:poly's vertices are unrounded -- they
-- reach the GPU as floats -- so a fractional design coordinate lands on the device pixel it names, where
-- g:frect and g:line round to whole design pixels first. Everything below is therefore Level's own
-- arithmetic, in Level's own unit, and the bar is that bar rather than an approximation of it.
